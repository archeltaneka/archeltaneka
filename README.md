## Hi!👋

I'm [Archel](https://archeltaneka.github.io), a data scientist based in Australia, enrolled in the final year of my Master's of Data Science at Monash University.

I turn messy datasets into slightly less messy insights, and occasionally convince computers to predict the future (results may vary).

My favorite child is [Table Tennis Analytics](https://www.github.com/archeltaneka/table-tennis-analytics) because apparently analyzing player positions with computer vision is easier than actually winning a match.

## 🔭 What I'm up to
Currently working remotely at Mercor, hopping between projects like a data-driven nomad. One day I'm building recommendation systems, the next I'm wrangling time series data that's as unpredictable as my sleeping schedule.

## 🛠️ My Arsenal
Languages I speak to machines:
Python, SQL,  R (when I'm feeling nostalgic)
My favorite toys:
scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas, NumPy, PySpark
Making things pretty:
Plotly, Seaborn, Tableau (because even data deserves good design)
Adulting tools:
Docker, Git, AWS, Jupyter (my second home)

## 💡 Fun facts
- I've probably spent more time debugging pandas indexing than actually analyzing data
- My model accuracy and caffeine levels are strongly correlated (r = 0.89, p < 0.001)
- I once spent 3 hours optimizing code that saved 2 seconds of runtime. Worth it.
